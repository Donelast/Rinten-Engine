It is C# - Core/Backend/Render/Browser - and it reaches the browser's WebGPU through wwwroot/webgpu.js, so what this builds on the native side is the same third-party C every other platform gets. ./build-web.sh            incremental ./build-web.sh fresh

# The archive twice: once as every browser build has had it, and once with threads. A .NET runtime built with WasmEnableThreads links with --shared-memory, and wasm-ld refuses that unless every object in the link was compiled with the atomics and bulk-memory features. So the two cannot share an archive, and the publish picks by name - see the NativeFileReference in Rinten-Web.csproj.
# Building both here rather than making it a switch means a threaded publish never fails on a stale single-threaded archive, which is a link error a long way from its cause. Both keep the name rintencore.a and differ by the folder they sit in: the name is what every [DllImport] in the engine resolves against, so it is part of the contract and not a label. The threaded one lives in mt/.
